# collectionsSankey_R
Used to create sankey flow diagrams for visualization, relies on googleVis and iGraph. See readme.

Must use the headers "source", "destination", and "weight" to define relationships between values. CSV required. 
I'll be migrating this to interface with Shiny to create web-apps for collection visualization.
